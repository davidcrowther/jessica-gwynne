            <cite>I did the Drink Less, Live More program to cut down on my drinking a little, to get healthy and lose a bit of weight. Also, I'd like to have a baby soon so I wanted to get ready for that. I learned SO much on the program, a LOT of lessons really hit home for me. Since completing the program I am no longer drinking during the weekdays at all, and on the weekend I am able to keep my drinking to a much more manageable level. I would totally recommend it to any woman.</cite>
